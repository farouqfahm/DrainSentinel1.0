                   Edge AI Application Competition 2025
================================================================================

PROJECT INFORMATION
================================================================================
Project Name:           DrainSentinel
Subtitle:              Edge AI for Flood Prevention
Target Region:         Lagos, Nigeria
Competition Track:     Edge AI Applications
Status:                Ready for Submission
Date:                  November 30, 2025

PROBLEM STATEMENT
================================================================================
Lagos, Nigeria, experiences frequent flooding due to drainage blockages and
inadequate infrastructure maintenance. Traditional monitoring relies on manual
inspection, which is time-consuming, costly, and reactive. DrainSentinel
provides real-time, autonomous monitoring using edge AI to detect blockages
and predict flooding before it occurs.

SOLUTION OVERVIEW
================================================================================
DrainSentinel is a multi-modal Edge AI application that combines three
independent machine learning models:

1. Visual Blockage Detection (MobileNetV2 CNN)
   - Detects debris and obstructions in drainage pipes
   - Accuracy: 87%
   - Latency: 350 ms

2. Water Level Monitoring (LSTM RNN)
   - Tracks water level changes using ultrasonic/Lidar sensors
   - Accuracy: 92%
   - Latency: 75 ms

3. Flood Risk Prediction (Gradient Boosting)
   - Predicts flooding based on environmental factors
   - Accuracy: 88%
   - Latency: 35 ms

All models run on edge hardware (Seeed XIAO ESP32-S3 Sense) with <1 second
total inference latency, requiring no cloud connectivity.
